Eat a Burger! is a burger logging app that utilizes MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM. I used Node and MySQL to query and route the data and Handlebars to generate the HTML. 

On the webpage, the user will see a list of Available Burgers and Devoured Burgers. The user can click 'Devour!' next to the list of Available burgers to move it down to the Devoured list. The user can also choose to add their own burger the the Available burger list, and then devour it that way. 

I would like to continue working on styling the app. Right now it is in a very basic format.
